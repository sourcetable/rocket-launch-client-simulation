# Rocket Launch Client Code Simulation

### Goal
Create a client that will give its users information about the history of rocket launches for a given date range.  Your application will consume a [rocket launch API](https://github.com/sourcetable/Samples.RocketLaunches) that provides data for all launches since 1959. 

### Requirements
Create a simple app that displayed rocket launches since 1959 for a given __date range__.  The app should display the following:

* Average launch cost
* Percent of launches where `mission_status` is `Success`
* The most popular month for rocket launches in that date range
* Top three `launch_locations`
* Top three __countries__ where `launch_locations` take place put on a visual map

Your application should be written for the browser in any framework you choose (or no framework). Your map can display the country boundary or a centered pin. The simulation should take less than three hours to complete. 

### MAP
You are welcome to use any mapping service you like. To save you time, and the requirement to add your credit card to some services, we have create a [Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) API key which you are welcome to use, and will be included in our email to you.

### Running the API
You will need to launch a local version of the API.  You can find the instructions to launch this API [here](https://github.com/sourcetable/Samples.RocketLaunches).

### Communication
Please reach out via text or email with any clarifying questions while you complete the simulation.

### What we are looking for:

* Clearly thought out application structure
* Logically chosen variable and function names
* Git [best practices](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
* A `README.md` with clear instructions on how to run you application on localhost


### How to submit your solution
* Make a private fork or clone of this repo
* When you're done, invite [@jeffj](https://github.com/jeffj) as a [admin](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization#permission-levels-for-repositories-owned-by-an-organization) to your repo and send __jeff@sourcetable.com__ an email.
